## General Information

### Project Information
BikeIndia, a well-known bike-sharing company in the US, provides people with short-term bike rentals via a system of computer-controlled docking stations. Bikes may be easily rented and returned at any dock in the system, which makes it a popular option for city commuting. However, the Covid-19 outbreak and the lockdowns that followed caused the company to lose a lot of money, which made it difficult for it to remain viable. BikeIndia has teamed up with a consulting firm to examine the elements that impact the demand for shared bikes and create a data-driven business plan in order to overcome this problem and prosper in the post-pandemic market.

### Project Background
Every industry has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the bike-sharing industry is no exception. BikeIndia's earnings significantly declined as a result of the lockdown procedures and limited mobility, endangering its place in the market. BikeIndia wants to comprehend the factors that influence demand for shared bikes in order to restore stability and adjust to the expected shifts in consumer behavior following the lockdown. The business looks for trends and insights that will help it efficiently meet future customer needs and differentiate itself from rivals, using a large dataset that captures daily bike demand and associated characteristics across the American market.

### Project Statement
BikeIndia is trying to position itself for success in the improving market while battling the problem of decreased sales brought on by the pandemic. The main issues to be addressed are:

1. Determining the key elements impacting the demand for shared bikes in the US market.
2. Evaluating the extent to which these variables account for fluctuations in bike demand.
3. Creating actionable insights to improve revenue in the post-pandemic era, anticipate client wants, and optimize operations.

The objective of this initiative is to give BikeIndia the strategic knowledge required to prosper in a cutthroat environment and guarantee long-term viability.

	
## Conclusions
The analysis offers insightful information about the variables influencing the demand for shared bikes in the US market. Through data analysis, it pinpoints important factors that impact bike utilization, including user preferences, weather, and other important factors.

The results provide practical suggestions to assist BikeIndia:

1. Recognize and predict post-pandemic customer demands.
2. Make processes and resource allocation more efficient.
3. Regain financial stability by remaining active in the market.

BikeIndia is ready to adjust its tactics, meet future demand, and accomplish long-term success in a cutthroat industry thanks to these insights.
